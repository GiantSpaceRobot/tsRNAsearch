	Trimming reads using Trim Galore
	================================

	

	Input: single-end read file
	
No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)

Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
1.15
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')


AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /home/paul/Documents/Pipelines/Reads/SimReads_tRNA-snomiRNA-mRNA.fq <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	12703	0.00
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	12703	0.00
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	12703	0.00
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count smallRNA: 0, count Nextera: 0)
Defaulting to Illumina universal adapter ( AGATCGGAAGAGC ). Specify -a SEQUENCE to avoid this behavior).

Writing report to 'SimReads_hisat/trim_galore_output/SimReads_tRNA-snomiRNA-mRNA.fq_trimming_report.txt'

SUMMARISING RUN PARAMETERS
