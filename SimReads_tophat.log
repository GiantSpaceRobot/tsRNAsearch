	Trimming reads using Trim Galore

	Input: single-end read file
	
No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)

Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
1.15
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')


AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /home/paul/Documents/Pipelines/Reads/SimReads_tRNA-snomiRNA-mRNA.fq <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	12703	0.00
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	12703	0.00
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	12703	0.00
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count smallRNA: 0, count Illumina: 0)
Defaulting to Illumina universal adapter ( AGATCGGAAGAGC ). Specify -a SEQUENCE to avoid this behavior).

Writing report to 'SimReads_tophat/trim_galore_output/SimReads_tRNA-snomiRNA-mRNA.fq_trimming_report.txt'

SUMMARISING RUN PARAMETERS
==========================
Input filename: /home/paul/Documents/Pipelines/Reads/SimReads_tRNA-snomiRNA-mRNA.fq
Trimming mode: single-end
Trim Galore version: 0.4.4_dev
Cutadapt version: 1.15
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; default (inconclusive auto-detection))
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 10 bp
Minimum required sequence length before a sequence gets removed: 15 bp

Writing final adapter and quality trimmed output to SimReads_tRNA-snomiRNA-mRNA_trimmed.fq
