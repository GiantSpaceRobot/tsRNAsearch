# Areas that would benefit from improvements

* Alignment (is it worth testing other aligners? e.g. STAR vs HISAT2?)
* Improvements to Cleavage or Distribution algorithms
  * Introduction of p-value calculation for both algorithms; what is a sensible null hypothesis?
* Suggestions of new algorithms to differentiate between control and treatment conditions?
* Code optimisation? Identification of bottlenecks such as plot generation (quite slow)
* Packaging of scripts more efficiently?
