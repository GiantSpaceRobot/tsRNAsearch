# tsRNAsearch to-do list

* Add multimapper counts to main count file so DESeq2 will use it. I'll need to add all tRNA species, even if they have 0 reads mapping as the number of features and order are vitally important. 
* Insert t-test table into PDF (if possible)
* Only top 4 tsRNAs shown in combined score FeaturePlot
* Correct Fisher's combined method for multiple testing?
* DESeq2 tRNA plots not sorted correctly (mouse mito tRNA pipeline version) (quick)
* Combined score plots fail to generate when n=1
* Single depthplotter PDF says RPM instead of TPM
