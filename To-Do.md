# tsRNAsearch to-do list

Update after publication:
* Add batch correction: DESeq2 in-built batch correction for DESeq2 analysis. limma batch correction on RPM-normalised count data for the rest of the pipeline?
* Should I normalise my Fisher method p-values by the length of each feature? Or the number of nucleotides that had more than 0 coverage?
* Integrate MINTmap tRNA fragment license plates for identified tsRNAs

Update now:
* Use GRCh38 ncRNA sequences
